<p><npc>Edwinna Elbert</npc> in the <loc>Ald-ruhn, Guild of Mages</loc> wants you to retrieve the excavation report from their expedition to <loc>Nchuleftingth</loc>.</p>
<p>Nchuleftingth ruins are northeast of Suran, which is northeast of Vivec. Once you arrive at the ruins <npc>Senilias Cadiusus</npc> and his daughter are quickly found just inside. It appears they have been having problems and their guide, <npc>Anes Vendu</npc>, is missing.</p>
<p>Enter the Test of Pattern section to find three cranks along the northeastern wall. Activating the last crank down the hall, will open a secret wall to the lower levels. Folloing the right wall you'll find the corpse of <npc>Anes Vendu</npc> at the bottom of the Lower Level, next to a disabled Dwemer robot and the book <item>Hanging Gardens of Wasten Coridale</item>. Pick up the book, loot Anes' body for his report, and return to <npc>Senilias Cadiusus</npc>, who will direct you to take the report back to Edwinna.</p>
