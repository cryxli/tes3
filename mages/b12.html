<h1>Kill Necromancer Tashpi Ashibael</h1>
<back></back>

<p><npc>Ranis Athrys</npc> in the <loc>Balmora, Guild of Mages</loc> sends you to end the necromancer <npc>Tashpi Ashibael</npc> in Maar Gan.</p>
<p>Maar Gan is far to the north, past Ald'ruhn. Ask the locals there about <npc>Tashpi Ashibael</npc> to learn that she lives in the last house (<loc>Maar Gan, Tashpi Ashibael's Hut</loc>) on the right before the shrine, and that she is a well-liked town healer.</p>
<p>When you confront <npc>Tashpi Ashibael</npc> about being a necromancer, she seems rather surprised, though once you mention <npc>Ranis Athrys</npc> she seems to understand. According to her, she refused to join the Mages Guild and <npc>Ranis Athrys</npc> has held a grudge against her ever since. <npc>Tashpi Ashibael</npc> suggests that you let her leave Vvardenfell and tell Ranis that she is dead. Otherwise, the only other solution is to kill <npc>Tashpi Ashibael</npc>.</p>
