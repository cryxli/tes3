<p><npc>Banvira Auctoria</npc> in the <loc>Firewatch, Guild of Mages</loc> informs you that <npc>Gindaman</npc> has a task for you. To pass the <item>Geth Sigil Amulet of Entry</item> to pass the magical barrier to his quarters.</p>
<p>Enter Gindaman's quarters and speak to him about duties while at the rank of Warlock or above. <npc>Gindaman</npc> will ask you to retrieve the <item id>Scroll of Forbidden Domination</item> from an enchantress named <npc>Ostrala Rouillac</npc>, who resides within the Velothi Mountains (<loc>Hasarund</loc>). He'll suggest that you pick up her trail by speaking to a scout, <npc>Derana Galvith</npc>, in the mountain settlement of Uman (<loc>Uman, Derana Galvith's House</loc>).</p>
<p>From Firewatch to Uman is quite a journey. Guild guide to Helnim, then a boat to Darvonis, and to Old Ebonheart, guild guide to Andothren, followed by a silt strider to Omaynis, then Bodrum. The paved road leaving Bodrum in a roughly southwesterly direction is the one to follow. It'll eventually wind down a steep slope into the Armun Ashlands, passed the Dwemer ruin of Mvelthngth-Schel. Continue following the cobbled section, over a rockslide, and deep into the Ashlands until you find a signposted junction to Uman. From there, follow the signs until you reach the sleepy Redoran village.</p>
<p><npc>Ostrala Rouillac</npc> is willing to part with the scroll, if you bring her the soul of a goblin warchief, Urak, found in the vast cavern system of Kharom (<loc>Kharom, Forges</loc>). Or, you can kill her.</p>
