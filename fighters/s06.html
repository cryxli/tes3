<p><npc>Hrundi</npc> in <loc>Sadrith Mora, Wolverine Hall: Fighter's Guild</loc> asks you escort the Bosmer researcher <loc>Sondaale</loc> of Shimmerene through the old Dunmer stronghold, <loc>Telasero</loc>. Hrundi warns you that Sondaale is not the most experienced in the field. she is currently waiting at Telasero, which is between Suran and the Silt Strider port near Molag Mar (it should be marked on your map).</p>
<p>Telasero is a large place and fairly easy to find. On the main door you find a note from Sondaale, saying that it looked safe and she went in to investigate. The fortress turns out to be a deathtrap, infested by Sixth House cultists, hiding in the darkness, illuminated only by eerie red candles. Two Dreamers greet you with ranged fire across the room. Make your way to the Lower Level, and kill any cultist and Ash Creatures on the way; depending on your level, this can include Ascended Sleepers. Luckily, Sondaale is still alive but imprisoned behind a locked door with a few rats keeping her screeching on a table. Once you have freed her, escort her to the exit, ideally by backtracking through areas you cleared on your way in to ensure her survival.</p>
