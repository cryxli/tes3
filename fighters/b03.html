<p><npc>Eydis Fire-Eye</npc> in <loc>Balmora, Guild of Fighters</loc> will ask you to kill four Telvanni agents responsible for thefts and kidnappings at the Caldera Mine.</p>
<p>If you don't know the way to the Caldera Mine, proceed to the town of Caldera and ask around about Caldera ebony mines; most people will give you directions. Proceed out of town through the west entrance and follow the directions and signs to the Caldera Mining company.</p>
<p>The lookout, whose name is <npc>Alveleg</npc>, just outside of <loc>Ashanammu</loc>, will allow you to approach, and will even chat with you a little. However, if you ask him about Telvanni agents, he'll turn hostile and attack. Eliminate him and then enter Ashanammu to take out the remaining three agents, <npc>Alynu Aralen</npc>, <npc>Sathasa Nerothren</npc> and <npc>Fothyna Herothran</npc>. They will attack as soon as they see you, and they are grouped together, so be prepared.</p>
