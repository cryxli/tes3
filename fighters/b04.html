<p><npc>Eydis Fire-Eye</npc> in <loc>Balmora, Guild of Fighters</loc> asks you to retrieve a code book currently held by <npc>Sottilde</npc> at the <loc>Balmora, South Wall Cornerclub</loc>. If you check with <npc>Percius Mercius</npc> he'll tell you that the mission seems okay but that you should try to avoid killing <npc>Sottilde</npc>. He calls her a "pushover" and suggests you talk her into handing it over.</p>
<p>If you are not a member of the <a href="../thieves/index.html">Thieves Guild</a> you can raise her disposition to 70 or more to get <item id>bk_sottildescodebook</item>. If you are a member of the guild, you have to pick her pocket. Taunting and subsequently killing her is also an option.</p>
