<h1>Vandacia's Bounty</h1>
<back></back>

<table class="table-sm mb-4">
<tr><th>Quest Giver</th><td><npc>Lorbumol gro-Aglakh</npc> in Vivec</td></tr>
<tr><th>Prerequisite Quest</th><td>rank of Protector and <a href="v04.html">Lirielle's Debt</a></td></tr>
<tr><th>Reward</th><td>500 gold,

</table>

<p>Once you reach the rank of Protector in the Guild, <npc>Lorbumol gro-Aglakh</npc> in the <loc>Vivec, Guild of Fighters</loc> will ask you to collect a bounty on <npc>Adraria Vandacia</npc>, in one of the Census and Excise buildings in Seyda Neen.</p>
<p>Just take a Silt Strider to Seyda Neen and kill the tax agent at the Census and Excise Warehouse. You could try taunting before attacking; after five successful taunts or so at 0/100 disposition Adraria Vandacia starts attacking you. She can be found on the top floor of the warehouse, so you will either have to unlock the ground floor door (opposite the building where you can find Sellus Gravius) or levitate/jump from the dock area to the door on the top floor, which deposits you right next to her. You can also find the key to the warehouse next to Sellus Gravius on the bookshelf (<loc>Seyda Neen, Census and Excise Warehouse</loc>).</p>
<p>Like some of Lorbumol's other quests, this one might raise your eyebrows. If you talk to <npc>Percius Mercius</npc> over in the Ald'ruhn Guild of Fighters for his advice on this one, he will tell you he's not sure why Lorbumol would order the bounty on the tax agent. He will suggest that you disobey his order and not kill her, though it's likely you won't be able to perform any more quests for Lorbumol.</p>
