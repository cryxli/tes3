<p><npc>Percius Mercius</npc> in the <loc>Ald-ruhn, Guild of Fighters</loc> asks you to help the Buoyant Armiger <npc>Ulyne Henim</npc> clean out a den of necromancers in <loc>Vas</loc>.</p>
<p>Vas is found far to the north in the Sheogorad Region (when you ask Percius about Vas, it will be marked on your map). The quickest route is to grab a boat to Dagon Fel.</p>
<p>An alternative route is to go north to Maar Gan, then farther north along the Foyada Bani-Dad until you reach the coast. Follow the shore eastwards until you reach the Urshilaku Camp, then swim (or waterwalk) northeast.</p>
<p>You'll find Ulyne Henim just outside the entrance to Vas. She's clad in the customary chitin armor of the Buoyant Armigers. Talk with Ulyne to join up together and enter the den. She fights with a staff and summons ancestor ghosts to help her in combat.</p>
<p>The Necromancer Daris Adram, who casts a few spells when he fights, is on the top floor of the tower. Once Daris is dead, Ulyne will thank you for helping and stop following you. If Ulyne is impressed with your performance (Disposition â‰¥ 70), then she will give you a glowing recommendation.</p>
