<p><npc>Hrundi</npc> in <loc>Sadrith Mora, Wolverine Hall: Fighter's Guild</loc> asks you deliver a load of sujamma to <npc>Nelacar</npc> in the <loc>Dunirai Caverns</loc>, southeast of the Ghostgate.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the location is not marked on your map, so you have a little exploring to do. If you haven't found the Ghostgate yet, it is south of the Red Mountain crater and roughly east of Caldera. The fastest method may be to grab a teleport from the Mages Guild upstairs in Wolverine Hall to Caldera, then Divine Intervention to the Fort below Ald'ruhn. From there, head east-northeast along the path until you see the Ghostfence. Follow the road south until you reach the Ghostgate area. From the Ghostgate, it is southeast over two hills to the mines.</p>
<p>If you do not have climbing skills or levitation to get over the hills, you can walk southwest from Ghostgate down the foyada until you come the path leading southeast between two tall spikes. Follow the path southeast until it opens into a wide plain heading east. Walk east between the Aryon Ancestral Tomb and Shishara. The plain will bear northeast toward a hill strewn with rocks and small spikes (due north from Marandus). Past that hill, turn due north until you come to the path leading west to the Dunirai Caverns.</p>
<p>Nelacar can be found a short distance inside the mine, beside a campfire.</p>
