<p><npc>Hrundi</npc> in <loc>Sadrith Mora, Wolverine Hall: Fighter's Guild</loc> asks you to kill <npc>Engaer</npc>, an outlaw in Tel Naga in Sadrith Mora. Hrundi suggests to avoid the guards as he doesn't need further trouble with the Telvanni.</p>
<p>Tel Naga Great Hall is just north of Wolverine Hall. There are two entrances into the Upper Tower, one high up from outside and one from inside the Lower Tower. You will need some form of levitation to reach either entrance. Engaer can be found in the northwest room of three trapped and locked (20) doors in the Upper Tower (<loc>Sadrith Mora, Tel Naga Upper Tower</loc>). The area is guarded by a single guard who is very close by, doesn't wander and stares you down continuously. You can taunt the guard into attacking if your sneak skill isn't high enough to untrap and unlock the door(s) undetected. Several residents hold a Key to Tel Naga which will open this door.</p>
<p>Since <npc>Engaer</npc> is a member of House Telvanni, you may find yourself kicked out of the faction because of this quest if you are also a member. To avoid this, you should either Taunt or cast Frenzy on him and allow him to strike the first blow before attacking him.</p>
