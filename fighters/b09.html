<p><npc>Eydis Fire-Eye</npc> in <loc>Balmora, Guild of Fighters</loc> tells you that a hunger has violated the <loc>Sarano Ancestral Tomb</loc>. You are to kill the hunger and return.</p>
<p>The tomb is over the hill southeast of Moonmoth Legion Fort between the Ashlands and Lake Amaya (you'll find it just to the north of the Fields of Kummu shrine along the main road). The hunger should be found behind the locked (10) door in the tomb. Until you attack it, it won't be hostile. It is much weaker than standard hungers. It doesn't use magic and its melee attack and hit points are about a third of the normal values. You'll still need a silver or better weapon to hit it though.</p>
