<p>Talk to Master <npc>Aryon</npc> (<loc>Tel Vos, Aryon's Chambers</loc>) about chores or advancement to learn that he can grant you the rank of Master now, which will give you an equal place on the Telvanni Council, but if you aspire to a higher claim, he can also grant you the title of Magister. By accepting the title of Magister, you are announcing that you deserve the title of Archmagister more than Gothren, who currently holds that rank.</p>
<p>If you choose to become Magister, <npc>Aryon</npc> will tell you that you have the support of the Telvanni Council, but you still have to dispose of Archmagister Gothren, who you will have to kill before taking his place. <npc>Gothren</npc> can be found in <loc>Tel Aruhn, Upper Tower</loc>.</p>
