<h1>The Corpse and the Skooma Pipe</h1>
<back></back>

<p>Overhear the latest rumors in Balmora or ask someone about their little secrets to discover that <npc>Larrius Varro</npc> wishes to speak with you.</p>

<p>Walking out of Balmora's northern gate, towards Caldera, past the bridge at the intersection of the road to Pelagiad you will soon see a large stone arch on the right just off the trail. Under this arch you can find the body of <npc>Ernil Omoran</npc>. Search his body to find a <i>note</i> to <npc>Tsiya</npc> and a <i>skooma pipe</i>, both of which you should take.</p>

<p>Travel back to Balmora and find Tsiya's home (<loc>Balmora, Tsiya's House</loc>) facing the Odai River on the west side. <npc>Tsiya</npc> is in her house, and her door is locked (50 points). Once inside, speak to <npc>Tsiya</npc> about Ernil's note by using the topic "Someone in Particular", and you'll be able to exchange it for 50 gold and 10 samples of <item>Moon Sugar</item>.</p>
