<p><npc>Caius Cosades</npc> in <loc>Balmora, Caius Cosades' House</loc> next task is to try to establish an Ashlander informant. He has heard rumors that <npc>Hassour Zainsubani</npc>, an Ashlander who is now a wealthy trader, is staying in Ald-ruhn. Caius gives you 100 gold and asks you to try and find out what he likes and buy him a present in the hopes of persuading him to talk about the Ashlanders tribes and their relationship to the Nerevarine Cult. Although Caius says he's not sure where to find this gentleman, he suggests the <loc>Ald-Ruhn, Ald Skar Inn</loc>.</p>
<p>Ald'ruhn is basically far north of Balmora, past Caldera. The quickest way is to grab a Silt Strider or use the Guild Guide from Balmora.</p>
<p>Find <npc>Hassour Zainsubani</npc> and ask him about business. That will bring up the topic about gifts. Chatting with him you indeed find out that it is an Ashlander custom to give gifts and that Hassour's passion happens to include poetry. Visit the local bookshops to see what books they have in stock:</p>
<ul>
    <li><item id>Words of the Wind</item> 45 gold</li>
    <li><item id>Ashland Hymns</item> 35 gold</li>
    <li><item id>The Five Far Stars</item> 25 gold</li>
</ul>
<p><npc>Hassour Zainsubani</npc> already owns all of them, but will accept them as a gift. Alternatively, if you raise his disposition to 80 or higher, you can discuss the Ashlander gift-giving customs, and he will take your "thought and effort" as a gift.</p>
<p>Once you get Hassour to talk with you about the Ashlanders and Nerevarine Cult, you'll receive his notes for Caius. Return to Caius.</p>
