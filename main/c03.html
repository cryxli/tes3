<p>After the last errand, <npc>Caius Cosades</npc> in <loc>Balmora, Caius Cosades' House</loc> tells you to train for a while and come back to him later. Specifically, your character needs to be at least level 3 before Caius will give you the next assignment.</p>
<p>Once you reach the threshold, he sends you to Vivec to talk to three different informats:</p>
<ul>
    <li><npc>Addhiranirr</npc>, a Khajiit Thieves Guild member in St. Olms</li>
    <li><npc>Huleeya</npc>, an Argonian Morag Tong assassin at the Black Shalk Cornerclub in the Foreign Quarter</li>
    <li><npc>Mehra Milo</npc>, a Tribunal Temple priestess in the Hall of Wisdom of the Temple Canton</li>
</ul>
<p>Caius is once again looking for any Sixth House or Nerevarine Cult information.</p>

<h2>Huleeya</h2>
<p><npc>Huleeya</npc> is in the <loc>Vivec, Black Shalk Cornerclub</loc>, in the Foreign Quarter Lower Waistworks. He should be easy to find, as he is the only Argonian in the room.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Huleeya seems to be having trouble with the locals, who will not let him pass. Talk with the Dunmer, <npc>Ethys Savil</npc>, or one of his two friends, and persuade him to leave the Argonian alone. Raising his disposition a bit will work, but so will homicide. If you try to leave with Huleeya without talking to one of the thugs, they will attack and you will have to protect Huleeya. Attacking the thugs first will result in Huleeya refusing to talk to you.</p>
<p>Once you've solved this, you may escort Huleeya unhindered to <loc>Vivec, Jobasha's Rare Books</loc>. Jobasha's bookshop is on the same level as the cornerclub, in the Foreign Quarter Lower Waistworks, just on the opposite side. Once you're inside the bookshop with Huleeya, you will receive one Reputation point for your help and he will give you some notes to take to Caius.</p>
<p>Also while at the bookshop, pick up the book <item>Progress of Truth</item> on the second floor far left bookcase as you will be needing it later in this quest. You can steal it when the Ordinator patrols elsewhere, or just buy it.</p>

<h2>Addhiranirr</h2>
<p><npc>Addhiranirr</npc> is the next closest contact in the St. Olms Canton, southeast of the Foreign Quarter (past the Redoran and next to the St. Delyn cantons). It turns out <npc>Addhiranirr</npc> is difficult to find as almost no one in St. Olms knows where she is. With enough exploration and questions, you do eventually find her all alone in the northeast Underworks, hiding from a Census and Excise agent.</p>
<p>In order to get anything out of her, the agent must be taken care of. The agent in question is <npc>Duvianus Platorius</npc>, who can be found in <loc>Vivec, St. Olms Waistworks</loc>. As usual, you can either kill him or persuade him that <npc>Addhiranirr</npc> has fled. Note that if you happen to accidentally tell him where Addhiranirr is, you can still get the information Caius wants by raising Addhiranirr's disposition until she will talk to you.</p>
<p>Anyway, once the agent is out of the way, Addhiranirr will let you know that the Sixth House is into smuggling, but no one knows what due to intense secrecy.</p>

<h2>Mehra Milo</h2>
<p>The last of the contacts is <npc>Mehra Milo</npc>. She may be found in the <loc>Vivec, Library of Vivec</loc>, located in the Hall of Wisdom in the Temple Canton at the southern end of Vivec.</p>
<p>Once you find her and follow her to the back of the library, she will tell you what she knows about the Nerevarine cult. She'll also suggest that you obtain a copy of the book <item id>Progress of Truth</item> for Caius. Although the library has a copy of the book, it is under guard, so she suggests trying the local bookshops, even though the book is officially banned by the Tribunal Temple. The copy in the library is the tall book on top of the bookshelf in the southwest corner. Alternatively, you can just buy a copy from Jobasha's Rare Books in the Lower Waistworks of the Foreign Quarter for 150 gold.</p>
