<p>Return to <npc>Caius Cosades</npc> in <loc>Balmora, Caius Cosades' House</loc> once you're cured. He informs you that he is being recalled to the Imperial City. His last orders to you before he leaves are to continue to investigate the lost prophecies, and to bring them to <npc>Nibani Maesa</npc> in the Urshilaku Camp once you find them.</p>
<p>First step is to meet <npc>Mehra Milo</npc> again in the Hall of Wisdom in Vivec's Temple Canton, and tell her what you have learned from the Urshilaku. She is no longer there. Since she was being watched and left a coded message, <item>Note to Amaya</item>, in her private quarters (<loc>Vivec, Milo's Quarters</loc>, level 20 lock, key behind a drape nearby).</p>
<p class="small">The note says that Milo is visiting the Inquisitor at the Ministry of Truth and that you should bring two Divine Intervention scrolls. She goes on to mention that the guard, <npc>Alvela Saram</npc>, will let you past if you mention you are looking for her and that she has left two levitation potions for you to use. Clearly, Milo has been imprisoned by the Ordinators and has left this coded message in the hope that you would find it.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Truth is the large meteor floating over the Temple Canton, which can only be reached using levitation. Outside the top entrance to the ministry you will find the guard <npc>Alvela Saram</npc>. Talking with her reveals that <npc>Mehra Milo</npc> is a prisoner and you are tasked with breaking her out. She gives you the main key and suggests to enter using the back door, which is the door furthest from Alvela. There are many locked doors inside the Ministry. They can be opened either by finding their respective keys or by lock picking them.</p>
<p>Once you enter the Ministry using the back door, immediately go right. Do not let anyone see you as they will attack and call the guards. You will not incur a bounty for killing any of the Ordinators. The Prison Keep is at the top of the Ministry and has only a level 20 lock guarding it. The Ministry of Truth Sector Key unlocks this door and is to the right of the upper entrance in the Grand Inquisitor's desk. Once you enter the Prison Keep, you may be attacked by a few guards, so be careful. <npc>Mehra Milo</npc> is located in the right-most holding cell ().</p>
<p>Once you find Mehra, she outlines the escape plan. You are to give her one <item id>sc_divineintervention</item> for her to make her escape. Using the other Divine Intervention scroll teleports you to Ebonheart. You are to meet each other at the secret Dissident Priests Monastery of Holamayan. You are to meet a woman on the east docks of Ebonheart (just southwest of Vivec) named <npc>Blatta Hateria</npc>. Tell Blatta that Mehra sent you and that you want to go fishing. Blatta will then bring you to <loc>Holamayan Monastery</loc> where you and Milo will meet up. Once there, you'll receive the lost prophecies from the Dissident Priests' leader <npc>Gilvas Barelo</npc>. Additionally, the entrance to Holamayan is concealed with magic. Speak to <npc>Vevrana Aryon</npc>, a monk on the dock at Holamayan about it.</p>
<p>Now that <npc>Caius Cosades</npc> is gone, you have no one to report to, but don't forget that <npc>Nibani Maesa</npc> in the <loc>Urshilaku Camp, Wise Woman's Yurt</loc> wanted to speak with you again once you've found the lost prophecies.</p>
