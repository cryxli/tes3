<p><npc>Caius Cosades</npc> in <loc>Balmora, Caius Cosades' House</loc> gives you a decoded copy of the original package you delivered to him, revealing that the Emperor intends to use you to fulfill the Nerevarine Prophecies, ensuring that things go his way.</p>
<p>He wants you to get to know the leaders of the Nerevarine Cult at the Urshilaku Camp, <npc>Sul-Matuul</npc> and <npc>Nibani Maesa</npc>. The camp is qutie far up on the northern coast. The quickest way is to take the silt strider or the guild guide from <loc>Balmora</loc> to <loc>Ald-ruhn</loc>, and, from there, take the silt strider to either <loc>Khuul</loc> or <loc>Maar Gan</loc>. The camp is a little way east from Khuul and north from Maar Gan. The journey from Khuul is shorter and safer, though there are almost no places of interest along the way.</p>

<h3>Zabamund</h3>
<p>When you raise their dispoation enough either through bribery or custom of gifts, the residents of the camp will point you to <npc>Zabamund</npc>, Sul-Matuul's second, in his yurt (<loc>Urshilaku Camp, Zabamund's Yurt</loc>).</p>
<p>To speak with Zabamund, you must raise your disposition with him to around 70 or higher first. Zabamund will then ask you to give him a reason to let you meet with the Ashkhan. As a result of any successful approach, Zabamund next sends you to the Ashkhan's yurt.</p>

<h3>Initiation</h3>
<p>If you have not first received permission from <npc>Zabamund</npc>, <npc>Sul-Matuul</npc> may immediately attack you. Once you have permission, however, there is no need to raise Sul-Matuul's disposition when meeting with him - he will speak to you straight away. As you are an outlander, Sul-Matuul is unsure of your intentions, and requires you to pass an initiation rite in order to be adopted into the Urshilaku Tribe as a Clanfriend. You are asked to travel to the tribal burial site (<loc>Urshilaku, Juno Burial</loc>) and retrieve the <item id>Bonebiter Bow of Sul-Senipul</item>, the weapon of his father. Upon returning with the bow, you will have proven your worth to the tribe.</p>
<p>Directions to the Urshilaku Burial Caverns are given, but can be rather confusing, and take you there via a pointlessly long route. Ignore them, and head south-southeast from the camp for a short distance; if you reach Abinabi cave, go east. Note that the actual map name of the site is <loc>Urshilaku, Astral Burial</loc> (the chamber where you enter the caverns).</p>
<p>The caverns are larger than most of the tombs scattered throughout the island, and filled with skeletons and cave rats. Go through the Astral Burial chamber (the entrance area) into the Karma Burial, and then enter the Laterus Burial. You may visit the various chambers at each stage, but your goal lies within the Juno Burial, found at the top of the spiral. At the far end of this chamber you encounter the Wraith of Sul-Senipul who carries (but for some reason doesn't use) the Bonebiter Bow of Sul-Senipul, which you must retrieve.</p>
<p>Upon your return with the bow to <npc>Sul-Matuul</npc> at the Urshilaku Camp, he congratulates you on completing the initiation rite and names you Clanfriend of the Ashlanders, thereby permitting you to talk to <npc>Nibani Maesa</npc>.</p>

<h3>Wise Woman</h3>
<p><npc>Nibani Maesa</npc> is in the <loc>Urshilaku Camp, Wise Woman's Yurt</loc> and has lots of very important answers regarding the prophecy. When she has finished, ask her if you pass the test. It seems that although you are not the Nerevarine, you are one who may become the Nerevarine.</p>
<p>In order to know more, <npc>Nibani Maesa</npc> asks you to find <item id>bk_thelostprophecy</item> and bring it to her, so that she may guide you better. She also gives you a copy of The Stranger and The Seven Visions relating to the Nerevarine Prophecy. This extended conversation with Maesa produces many dialogue topics; you should probably explore all of them as they are more relevant than average to the Main Quest's plot and what is coming up in your adventures. When you have the required Journal entry, which ends with "Now it's time to report back to Caius", you may do so for your next assignment and a reward of 400 gold.</p>
