<p>During the last quest to destroy the Sixth House base near Gnaar Mok, you contracted the apparently incurable Corprus Disease. While you have Corprus, the disposition of anyone you talk to will drop significantly, so it's a good idea to return to <npc>Caius Cosades</npc> in <loc>Balmora, Caius Cosades' House</loc> as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Back in Balmora, Caius is shocked to hear of your condition, but believes there may be hope. He has learned from <npc>Edd Theman</npc>, a local Telvanni expert, that a Telvanni wizard named <npc>Divayth Fyr</npc> runs a Corprusarium deep beneath his tower in Tel Fyr, dedicated to the study of Corprus disease, and is your best chance for a cure. Apparently, Fyr is a collector of Dwemer artifacts, and Caius provides you with a <item>Dwemer Coherer</item> to help raise Divayth's disposition. You will also receive 1000 gold to pay for your expenses and a few levitation potions for use in the tower. The artifact weighs 40 pounds, so be sure you're able to carry that much.</p>
<p>Tel Fyr is on an island in the eastern archipelago of Vvardenfell, in the Azura's Coast Region. The fastest way to get there is to take a Guild Guide over to Sadrith Mora. <npc>Divayth Fyr</npc> can be found in his study in <loc>Tower of Tel Fyr, Hall of Fyr</loc>. You will need to levitate to the upper level. Give him the <item>Dwemer Coherer</item> and ask him about corprus disease. You may have to additionally raise his Disposition through persuasion or other means in order to get him to talk to you. Divayth has plenty to say about the disease, but mention that you may fulfill the Nerevarine Prophecies and he will quickly offer you an experimental and possibly fatal cure for Corprus. However, before he agrees to give you the cure, he will ask you to fetch a pair of enchanted boots from <npc>Yagrum Bagarn</npc> in the Corprusarium below and return them to him.</p>
<p><npc>Yagrum Bagarn</npc> is in the <loc>Tel Fyr, Corprusarium Bowels</loc> in a little alcove. He'll give you the <item id>Dwemer Boots of Flying</item>. The Corprusarium houses multiple Corprus victims. You are not to harm them at all. Just run past them.</p>
<p>Bring the boots to <npc>Divayth Fyr</npc> and accept the experimental potion. It turns out that the potion doesn't actually cure you, but just removes the negative effects of the disease. Therefore, you have the complete disease resistance that Corprus gives, but no loss of attributes.</p>
